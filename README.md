64-bit algorithm for factoring the product of two prime numbers

This program was created to test the algorithm for factoring the product of two prime numbers. 
It operates on floating-point numbers with an exponent in base two. 
It contains fast operations of 64-bit multiplication, addition, subtraction, significant bit conversion in assembly language, 
as well as fast division and square root operations in C++ using the Bakhshali method or finding its inverse using Newton's method.
